What Parcel is doinf for us:
-created Dev build
-created local server
-automaticaly refreshes our page which is called HMR(Hot Module Replacement)
-it uses a File Watching Algorithm (written in C++)which see all changes we do and reflect it to server. it keeps track of all the save we do in project and build our app again n again.
-it uses caching which gives faster builds (.parcel-cache).
-does Image optmization
-if we do production build it will minify file also i.e. does minification
-will do bundling
-will compress our file
